# Collaborative-filtering-on-MovieLens
This repository has implementation of following algorithms for collaborative filtering on movielens dataset
1) [Belief propogation based on Pairwise Markov Random Field](http://fekri.ece.gatech.edu/Publications/2012_06.pdf) 
2) Restricted Boltzman Machine
3) Deep Belief Network
4) Stacked Autoencoder. (An implementation of the paper [Training Deep AutoEncoders for Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01715.pdf)).
5) Variational Autoencoder

### Dataset:
MovieLens dataaset is used for the task of collaborative filtering. This dataset has a set of users who have given ratings to a set of movies.
